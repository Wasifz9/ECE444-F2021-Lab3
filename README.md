#### Activity 5 
##### Non-Functional
A specific non-functional requirement I cant wait to change is reducing on-screen text to improve readability, and in turn, usability. Both on home page and in search results, there’s an overload of text that makes results hard to traverse. With color coding and expandable containers, a lot of information can be transferred to users with much less text, and instead, with much more digestible and interactive content. This would not change the core functionality of the app, but would make the functionality of the app much easier to consume. 

User story: As a user, I only want relevant information to appear on screen, so that I can quickly identify the content of interest and collect the inforamtion I need from the application. 

##### Functional
Users should be able to mark courses as “taken”. This would facilitate better search results, and course, program and certificate suggestions. This functional requirement is currently non existing in the app, with students having to remember/self-track prerequisites. This would change core functionality as many suggestions, filters, and search results will behave differently based on the user's history.

User story: As a user, I want to mark courses as 'taken' so that I can receive suggestions, filters and results which are specific to my educational situation.
